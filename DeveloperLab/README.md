# Developer Lab Materials
We will be going through 2 labs to help you learn Azure Funcations and Logic Apps. If you get through both, try the challenge or the Event Grid lab.

[Azure Logic App Lab](./Logic App Lab/)

Challenge: Create a Logic App that will trigger on new rejected images from your Function Lab and notify you via e-mail.
